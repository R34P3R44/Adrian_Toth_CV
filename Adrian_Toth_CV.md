# Adrian Toth

I was always fascinated by computers and making something in technology, so I built my first desktop PC at age 13. 
After successfully graduating as a law administrator I realised that I wasn't sure if I really wanted to work in a law firm. Years went by until one day I made a very bold decision, I bought a one way ticket to London.The “now or never” moment in my life, no safety net.
Few years later changing from Hospitality to the Retail industry had given me new excitements but not as much as tech gives me. 

One day in 2019 I was browsing for tutorials on how to run a Mac OS on Windows when I stumbled across videos where someone was teaching people how to make games using Python language. This was the moment when I decided to teach myself the basics of Python and build my first ever game using the turtle module. The success of this project really empowered me and I looked for further studies on Codecademy and Codewars.
Few months later I enrolled in a 16 weeks intensive coding course at Makers Academy.

| A 3D first person shooter micro game built with Unity engine using C# language. Some of the interesting features of the game include 5 different custom built door animations, upgraded weapons, enemies will not only feel realstic in terms of the damage delt by them but also in movement and adaptation to the player. The game itself is still in progress but this is only including some final touches like post-processing and testing. The initial date of completion is planned for 14.03.2021.|

## Skills
### **Problem solving**
I use my initiative and a  methodical approach to deal with problems. I used my problem solving skills throughout the Makers course where I was constantly facing new challenges with either the code or finding a new approach to implement logic in my idea. I also had to be creative at my previous roles where I figured out how a barcode scanner connected to a Surface Pro and an excel sheet can work together to help me conduct my annual stock take. Lately I started with “pico CTF”  where I made 1050 points in 4 hours competing in challenges that are all about reverse engineering, hacking and decrypting.
### **Teamwork**
I began to master my collaboration and communication skills as a bar waiter at the Goring hotel. There I learned how to adapt to each of my colleagues and to their dynamics. I was working in a very busy bar where I had to ensure my team was able to cope with the ever changing landscape of different services as well as events. We were serving breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as afternoon tea. Some of the most challenging tasks were changing the layout between services during active service as well as managing lunch, afternoon tea and dinner service at the same time. This sounds pretty straight forward however most of the time we had late lunch reservations with early afternoon tea bookings and on top of that usually the last afternoon tea table stayed for dinner too. 

Few years later I changed industries to Retail where I had the opportunity to further develop this skill as a stock controller at Holland & Holland and Matches Fashion. At both places I started developing a new team culture which required implementing new strategies to create a supportive, fun and efficient working environment. We started having regular morning meetings where we discussed the plans for the day as well as for the week and also celebrated each other's achievements. We redesigned our stockroom layout, supported each other with general help, training as well as whether it was a sale or a stock issue. I believe emotional safety is very important therefore we had regular one on one meetings with each other to ensure that everyone's voice was heard. 
### **Self-teaching**
Before signing up to Makers I learnt the basics of Ruby and had experience in Java and Python languages. In September 2020 I have started a 16 weeks full-time immersive course at Makers Academy.
I have continued the above mentioned “pico CTF” challenges that are not only entertaining but teaches me about cyber security. Currently I'm learning the Unity game engine with C# and in the process of making my first fps micro game.
