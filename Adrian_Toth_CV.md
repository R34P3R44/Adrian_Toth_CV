# Adrian Toth

I was always fascinated by computers and making something in technology, so I built my first desktop PC at age 13. 
After successfully graduating as a law administrator I realised that I wasn't sure if I really wanted to work in a law firm. Years went by until one day I made a very bold decision, I bought a one way ticket to London.The “now or never” moment in my life, no safety net.
Few years later changing from Hospitality to the Retail industry had given me new excitements but not as much as tech gives me. 

One day in 2019 I was browsing for tutorials on how to run a Mac OS on Windows when I stumbled across videos where someone was teaching people how to make games using Python language. This was the moment when I decided to teach myself the basics of Python and build my first ever game using the turtle module. The success of this project really empowered me and I looked for further studies on Codecademy and Codewars.
Few months later I enrolled in a 16 weeks intensive coding course at Makers Academy.

| A 3D first person shooter micro game built with Unity engine using C# language.<br>Some of the interesting features of the game includes few custom built door<br>animations, upgraded weapons, enemies will not only feel realstic in terms of the<br>damage delt by them but also in movement and adaptation to the player.<br>Check out my game <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/escap3-dt">here.</a> | <div align="center">C#, Unity game engine v 2019.04.16f1</div>

| Uptodate is an app that can help us stay organised with our expriation dates.<br>The inspiration is coming from one of my previous jobs where I was dealing with loads<br>of expiration date checks of different food items. Some of theproducts had quite<br> a long shelflife therefore I thought its pointless to check them each week,<br>instead of that I can make an app that can scan a date format<br>using OCR technology. When the scan is done the app will set up a reminder in my iOS<br>calendar which will tell me when that product is expiriing.<br>These reminders can be amended therefore I can set up different time frames if needed.  | <div align="center">Swift, C</div>

|One of the first challenges of Maker Academy emphasising on the basic principles like<br>OOP, encapsulation and SRP. The famous bike renting app copycat that lets people hire<br>and return bikes. Each station has a maximum capacity of bikes and checks if the<br>bike is still working. Broken bikes will be accepted at all stations but wont be released<br>until it is fixed.  | <div align="center">Ruby, RSpec</div> |

## Skills
### **Problem solving**
I use my initiative and a  methodical approach to deal with problems. I used my problem solving skills throughout the Makers course where I was constantly facing new challenges with either the code or finding a new approach to implement logic in my idea. I also had to be creative at my previous roles where I figured out how a barcode scanner connected to a Surface Pro and an excel sheet can work together to help me conduct my annual stock take. Lately I started with “pico CTF”  where I made 1050 points in 4 hours competing in challenges that are all about reverse engineering, hacking and decrypting.
### **<u>Teamwork</u>**
I began to master my collaboration and communication skills as a bar waiter at the Goring hotel. There I learned how to adapt to each of my colleagues and to their dynamics. I was working in a very busy bar where I had to ensure my team was able to cope with the ever changing landscape of different services as well as events. We were serving breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as afternoon tea. Some of the most challenging tasks were changing the layout between services during active service as well as managing lunch, afternoon tea and dinner service at the same time. This sounds pretty straight forward however most of the time we had late lunch reservations with early afternoon tea bookings and on top of that usually the last afternoon tea table stayed for dinner too. 

Few years later I changed industries to Retail where I had the opportunity to further develop this skill as a stock controller at Holland & Holland and Matches Fashion. At both places I started developing a new team culture which required implementing new strategies to create a supportive, fun and efficient working environment. We started having regular morning meetings where we discussed the plans for the day as well as for the week and also celebrated each other's achievements. We redesigned our stockroom layout, supported each other with general help, training as well as whether it was a sale or a stock issue. I believe emotional safety is very important therefore we had regular one on one meetings with each other to ensure that everyone's voice was heard. 
### **Self-teaching**
Before signing up to Makers I learnt the basics of Ruby and had experience in Java and Python languages. In September 2020 I have started a 16 weeks full-time immersive course at Makers Academy where I learned how to build web applications and deployed 2 web apps within 6 weeks with full test coverage.
I have continued the above mentioned “pico CTF” challenges that are not only entertaining but teaches me about cyber security. I got very familiar with the Unity game engine as well as C# and finished my FPS shooter game within few months. Recently started learning iOS decvelopment and Swift and im currently half way through building my first iOS app.
